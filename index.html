    <div class = 'row'>
      <h1 class = 'title'>Executive Summary</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>RapidVisa recently commissioned Causal Design, an independent research firm based in Washington D.C., to examine statistics and trends for K-1 <a href='https://rapidvisa.com/k1-visa-requirements/'>fiancé visa</a> applications. The resulting report provided quantitative insights into several macro trends for international fiancés. In particular, we detailed experiences for applicants here in the United States as they worked through the immigration process.</p1>
    </div>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <p class = 'notbold'>This report revealed emerging trends for this evolving area of public policy. Over the past 30 years, K-1 fiancé visa issuances <a href='https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html'>have increased</a> by 75%, and recent Census data <a href='https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2013/cb13-157.html'>reveal</a> that 21% of all married-couple households in the U.S. have at least one foreign-born spouse. In this report, Causal Design builds on our previous work by exploring the diverse experiences of these applicants far earlier in this process. This report utilizes RapidVisa’s proprietary qualitative data to describe how and where eventual K-1 applicants meet. More specifically, we examine the evolving experience of meeting online, and analyze the cultural and demographic nuances that shape these statistics.</p1>

    <h1 class = 'title'>Key Findings</h1>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <ul>
        <li class = 'notbold'><strong>Over 55 percent of K-1 applicants first met online.</strong>The majority of these respondents mention using a dating site, which tend to emphasize the Asian region, and particularly the Philippines. The Philippines are also a common locale for religiously-based couples (couples who self-report meeting on dating sites focused on religious beliefs).</li>
        <li class = 'notbold'><strong>Facebook supports over 80 percent of all social media meeting stories.</strong> The platform provides room for more diverse partnerships across the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Facebook may be a medium for emotional expression in countries with limited freedoms, increasing its growth potential in this space.</li>
        <li class = 'notbold'><strong>Couples who met through online gaming are a quickly growing group.</strong>These couples trend younger, with many more fiances from Europe or Canada. The UK, a fast-growing K-1 visa population, represents one fourth of fiances in this space.</li>
        <li class = 'notbold'><strong>Meeting in person is also a common pathway for K-1 applicants.</strong>Meeting through business, on vacation, or through friends and family tends to occur disproportionately with Latinx fiances.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <h1 class = 'title'>K-1 Background</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>While the history of K-1 visas is explored in-depth in our <a href='https://rapidvisa.com/k1-visa-report/'>previous report</a>, the following provides a brief introduction to inform the work below. The K-1, or “fiancé visa,” allows future spouses of U.S. citizens to enter the United States in order to marry, and ultimately apply for an adjustment to immigrant status. In practice, the K-1 serves as a nonimmigrant visa bridge to permanent spousal immigration status. Originally intended to assist U.S. soldiers in bringing fiancés home after World War II, globalization, and the international mobility that accompanied it, has driven an increase in the number of U.S. citizens marrying (and intending to marry) non-U.S. citizens.</p1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>Our previous report provides some context into the qualitative findings below. First, we found that Filipino K-1 visas dwarfed every other nationality, accounting for nearly twenty percent of all K-1 visas in 2017 and surpassing the next five nationalities combined. While East European and East Asian countries have seen significant declines in K-1 visas since 2005 (Chinese nationals were only three percent of applicants in 2017), Brazil, the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom have registered increasing numbers. Across these nationalities, students represent a plurality of applicants.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>But what social factors might explain these trends? Our macro-level insights are fleshed out and further explored within this report.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <h1 class = 'title'>Data Description</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>This report is based on a proprietary random sample of 4,979 RapidVisa customers collected between 2010 and 2019. In 2018, RapidVisa was responsible for processing 13.6% of all K-1 visas. As such, this sample may be sufficiently relevant to the broader population of K-1 applicants in considering generalizability of this report’s findings.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>As part of the K-1 application process, applicants must disclose in a free-form narrative the story of how they met. Therefore, this information is collected in all RapidVisa’s customer accounts along with what social mediums factored prominently into their courtship. These qualitative data were then sorted and scored to give indications of what mediums were predominant in each meeting story.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>While randomly drawn, RapidVisa’s status as an online company may introduce some bias towards more internet-savvy K-1 visa applicants, and should be noted in any comparison of online versus in-person mediums present below. Furthermore, the self-reported nature of these data may introduce a bias towards answers perceived to be more socially acceptable to applicants.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>The Venn diagram below gives an initial picture of the data after processing. Couple stories may incorporate various forms of communication, as is depicted by any points of overlap. Each of these interactions and the general distribution is covered by this report.</p>

      <h1 class = 'title'>New Ways to Meet</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>The Venn diagram above describes an increasingly interconnected world, where international dating takes place across both traditional and modern forms of communication. International fiances may still meet through business or through military deployment, with roughly 45 percent of respondents reporting some in-person interaction being integral to their meeting.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>INSERT GRAPH 2</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>However, these modes are increasingly in competition with online mediums, where the majority of respondents report first meeting their international fiance. Roughly 20 percent of respondents now report using social media or a chat app in their courtship, while over 35 percent date online. These results are broadly in line with dating trends in the United States, as reported by the <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/'>Pew Research Center</a>. From 2005 to 2015, stigma surrounding online dating decreased significantly, and the total number of respondents reporting online dating use rose from 11 to 15 percent. This trend is especially strong for more recent relationships, with a recent Stanford <a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_et_al_Disintermediating_Friends.pdf'>study</a> estimating 39 percent of couples who met in 2017 doing so through social media.</p>
      <p class = 'notbold'>Where domestic and international dating does differ is the rate of becoming engaged among those using online dating. While 35 percent of RapidVisa respondents reported finding fiances at least in part through dating online, only five percent of Pew respondents who met online in the U.S reported being in either a marriage or a committed relationship. The reasons for this discrepancy are not well reported, but it is likely that both selection into international dating and the nature of dating across wide distances play a substantial role.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = 'row'>
    <h1 class = 'title'>Dating Sites</h1>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Among these emerging online mediums, dating websites remain the most common way for international fiances to meet. Over 60 percent of RapidVisa respondents that reported meeting online mention using a dating site at some point in their courtship. Following a data deduplication process, the top 10 sites mentioned by respondents are highlighted below.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>One notable trend is the popularity of specialized dating sites when compared to more general dating forums. While Tinder and OkCupid both appear in the top 10, they represent similar shares of respondents to far more specialized sites dedicated to either regions or even particular countries.</p>

  <div class = 'row'>
    <p class = 'notbold'>In general, top dating sites appear to disproportionately specialize in the Asian region; AsianDating, Blossoms, and DateInAsia alone represent over 13 percent of dating site traffic in our sample. This reflects the broader demographics for international fiances, where over half of respondents report their sponsored fiance being from the Asian continent (54.7 percent). These trends are more pronounced for those meeting on a dating site, with 67 percent of sponsored fiances being of Asian heritage.</p>
    <p>INSERT GRAPH 3 HERE</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>But perhaps the most interesting finding is the prominence of dating sites specialized specifically for the Philippines. FilipinoCupid tops the list, accounting for nearly 15 percent of all dating site traffic alone. The prominence of Filipino fiances in our sample corresponds to our previous report, where they accounted for nearly twenty percent of all 2017 K-1 visas. Filipino sponsored fiances appear disproportionately likely to meet through dating sites, representing 54 percent of this subsample.</p>

    <p class = 'notbold'>However, the exact relationship between the proliferation of dating sites and the number of Filipino fiances is unclear. Regular internet use in the Philippines, at <a href='https://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/'>43.5 percent in 2016</a>, is not significantly higher than other similar countries in the Asian region. Instead, this may be a result of the historical origins of the K-1 visa and the close military relationship between the Philippines and the United States during World War II.</p>

Our previous report also highlights these as being emerging international fiance origin nations since the late 2000’s. For each, dating sites are a meaningful avenue to meeting U.S. fiances: over 40 percent of eventual Colombian fiances met their sponsor through the medium, as did nearly 30 percent of Domican fiances. Like the Philippines, each have distinctive dating sites dedicated to their respective sub-regions or countries.</p>

Between this and ChristianDatingForFree, Filipino fiances make up approximately 65 percent of the religion-based online dating market. In general, Christian relationships are far more common in our random sample; websites implying a Christian focus command over three fourths of the market.</p>

    <p class = 'notbold'>But where in the United States are these international fiances applying to enter? RapidVisa data indicates a substantial spread across cities, with the top city for dating site fiances (Las Vegas) only representing around one percent of the total. Aggregating by origin nation reveals similarly sparse results, suggesting there are not ‘hotspots’ of activity for any one nationality or the dating site industry as a whole. Filipino fiances are relatively more prevalent in Las Vegas and Phoenix while Colombians appear more commonly in Orlando, Florida.</p>

    <h1 class = 'title'>Social Media</h1>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Social media is a relatively recent addition to the international dating environment making gains in the digital space. As late as 2015, dating site-based matched couples dwarfed those that were introduced through social media by a factor of 4 to 1. Today, social media has not only halved this discrepancy, but alone accounts for 15 percent of all international relationships found in our data.</p>
    <p>INSERT GRAPH 5 HERE</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>This traffic is overwhelmingly conducted through Facebook. Over 83 percent of RapidVisa respondents who met through social media did so on Facebook. This far surpassed Facebook’s next contenders, Instagram (8.4 percent) and Twitter (1.7 percent). As with dating sites, Filipinos represent the majority of Facebook matches, with roughly 20 percent of all Filipino international fiances reporting meeting on the platform. However, this is where many similarities to the online dating market end.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>While international fiances who met on dating sites disproportionately came from Asian countries, Facebook matches are far more geographically diverse. Top nationalities range from South and Central America to Africa and the European continent. Nigerians, Ghanaians, and Pakistanis are particularly well-represented on the platform, where more than a quarter of all matches occur. Pakistan is a particular outlier, where Facebook couples represent 40 percent of respondents in the RapidVisa sample.</p>

    <p class = 'notbold'>The ubiquity of Facebook relationships in countries with limited freedoms may be perplexing, especially given that many of these nations often restrict internet access and monitor social media. However, <a href='https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2018/rise-digital-authoritarianism'>Freedom House data</a> on relative openness suggests there may be a non-spurious correlation between the restriction of rights and the use of social media as the primary medium for emotional life.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Among the 68 percent of our sample living in nations defined as ‘partly free’, over 17 percent of couples reported meeting on Facebook - over double the rate found in nations defined as ‘free’ (8.2%). This is in line with <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/19/facebook-pakistan-blasphemy-laws-censorship'>qualitative reports</a> which suggest Facebook has historically been seen as an avenue of free expression in otherwise restricted societies. However, this is not without limitation - in places like Pakistan and China, Facebook has recently been repurposed to allow greater monitoring in ways that might restrict use of the platform in the international dating space. Indeed, in our data we see only 9.4 percent of fiances in ‘not free’ nations using the site to meet U.S. partners.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Facebook’s gains in the social media space are particularly interesting given the minimal overlap between social media and other forms of digital meeting found in our data. Less than one percent of respondents mentioned using both a dating site and social media in their courtship, and even fewer reported use of a chat app. There is, however, substantial overlap between reporting meeting through friends or family and social media -  nearly 10 percent, versus being virtually nonexistent in the dating site group.</p>

    <p class = 'notbold'>The lack of multi-platform respondent stories and this distinction suggest either (1) these mediums are in direct competition or (2) are appealing to different potential user groups. Based on a comparison of demographic characteristics for these two user bases, differences appear to be minimal enough to suggest the former. Social media couples tend to be younger, but this is likely a result of there being more couples later in our random sample as social media became increasingly ubiquitous.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>One substantive variation is in the number of international fiances from the African continent, who represent 14 percent of Facebook relationships. However, this may be due to more systemic factors. Unlike the Asian (and particularly Filipino) context, internet availability remains <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/10/09/internet-use-is-growing-across-much-of-sub-saharan-africa-but-most-are-still-offline/'>relatively low</a> in sub-Saharan Africa. Pew research <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/10/09/sub-saharan-africans-say-internet-use-has-positively-impacted-education-personal-relationships-and-economy/'>finds</a> those that do have access trend towards greater use of social media exclusively, to both keep up with family and friends and to explore further relationships. As such, there may be less interest in pursuing relationships on other sites or platforms. These factors likely account for the discrepancy seen in our sample.</p>

  <div class = 'row'>
    <h1 class = 'title'>Meeting Through Gaming</h1>
    <p class = 'notbold'>By far the most recent development in our match data is the emergence of couples meeting through online gaming platforms. Representing only 2.3 percent of our sample, this group tends to report meeting across multiple online mediums, including those social media platforms discussed above. But this group is also differentiated in both its demographic characteristics and the distribution of international fiances from across the world.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>While there is substantial overlap between social media and gaming fiance matches, the gaming subgroup of domestic fiances is substantially younger - the median sponsor age is 11 years less than that found for social media. Interestingly, alien fiance age does not substantially decrease, suggesting gaming relationships to be the most common to occur within similar age cohorts across our entire sample. The median age difference for these couples is less than half that found for either dating sites or on social media.</p>

  <div class = 'row'>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Meeting through gaming also appears to be more common for different groups of international fiances. Unlike social media and dating site mediums, a significant plurality of gaming fiances are from Europe (40.2 percent) or Canada (15.2 percent). Asian fiances account for only 24 percent of this gaming group of couples, in stark contrast to other online media discussed.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>But what might explain this significant variation from the patterns seen in other mediums? One explanation may be the higher likelihood of being sent to the same servers in MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role-playing games) and other online-based games. Massive online games will often partition players by linking them to the closest physical server to reduce lag time experienced while online. This in turn may lead to greater opportunities to connect for U.S. gamers to other countries in Northern America and on the European continent. This technical constraint provides selective interconnectivity for domestic gamers, meaning that interactions with Asian gamers may be minimal despite Asia containing over <a href='https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/#online-gaming'>four times</a> the online gamers found in all of Europe.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>It also may not be coincidence that many gaming international fiances come from English-speaking nations. Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia each represent a substantial portion of this gaming couples group, as described in the table below. The Philippines also has one of the highest rates of English-learning found in Asia, with a 2000 Census of Population and Housing conducted by the <a href='https://psa.gov.ph/tags/census-population-and-housing'>Philippine National Statistics Office</a> finding 63.7 percent of Filipinos spoke English. In online games, online chatting normally takes the form of either voice snippets or fast text messaging, meaning ease with English lends itself to more in-depth communication opportunities between gamers.</p>

    <p class = 'notbold'>These data also suggest that the recent uptick in UK fiance K-1 applications may be linked, at least in part, to increasing opportunities to meet online through gaming. Our last report highlighted the United Kingdom as one of the fastest growing origins for international fiances, though the reasons remained unclear in top-line numbers. With roughly a fifth of all UK fiances in this sample meeting through online gaming, it appears this growing medium may be a major player towards this trend.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>The sparse data available describing which games fiances report meeting on suggest a fractured medium, but also reinforce some of the conclusions drawn above. The top five games are all MMORPGs requiring partitioned servers by region to effectively operate. Of these, World of Warcraft commands nearly a tenth of the market, while newer games such as League of Legends and Game of War round out the top three. Importantly, many of these games emphasize a team-building component: World of Warcraft is a team adventure game that encourages in-game partnerships and friendships, while League of Legends is an e-sport where teams compete together against other teams. This inter-player relationship focus is likely the reason they make the list over more individual-based gaming options.</p>

    <h1 class = 'title'>Meeting In-Person</h1>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Despite extensive discussion on emerging online mediums, the plurality of connections between international fiances still occur face-to-face. Nearly 45 percent of our sample report in-person interactions factoring heavily into meeting and courting their fiance. While meeting through friends/family (44 percent) or through an unexpected moment (34 percent) are most common, the extent of overlap between different mediums defines this space.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>For example, 34 percent of those meeting through business also reported unexpected encounters being instrumental to their relationship; 13 percent of those on vacation reported family or friends helping meet their eventual fiance. This in many ways reflects the less siloed circumstances found offline, where meeting can occur organically through multiple pathways in the public forum.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>What is apparent is the lack of overlap between these in-person pathways and the online mediums discussed above. Fewer than five percent of couples meeting in-person reported any use of online communication, suggesting that this subgroup may differ from our overall sample. Indeed, demographics characteristics of both sponsors and international fiances differ - sponsors trend younger, which acts to limit the age gap towards what is seen for the relatively young online gaming couple group. Whereas dating sites and social media groups primarily sponsor fiances from the Asian continent, in-person meetings are far more likely in the Americas.</p>

    <h1 class = 'title'>Conclusion</h1>
    <p class = 'notbold'>This report fleshes out the story behind several macro-trends discovered in our previous report. The historical origins of the K-1 visa in the military community have expanded broadly across both groups of citizens in the U.S. and various regions abroad. While many K-1 fiances do still meet through military deployment, the modal story is increasingly taking place online.</p>
    <p class = 'notbold'>Facebook, dating sites, and other large international platforms are becoming the public forum through which these relationships begin. Our analysis suggests these shifts create room for a greater diversity of partnerships from across the world, allowing relationships to flourish across thousands of miles. The trends observed in K-1 visa applicants are also common to the larger story about dating in the United States. This societal shift makes it likely that the evolving patterns explored in this report will continue into the foreseeable future.</p>
